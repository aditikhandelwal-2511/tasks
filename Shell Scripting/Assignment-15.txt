Create a script that prompts the user for a number. That number is to be used to display a simple message to the terminal X number of times (where X is the number captured from the user input). The message should include an indication of the number for each count the message is displayed.


Ans:
i=1
while [ $i -le $1 ]
do 
echo "$i I am Aditi"
i=$(($i+1))
done

Output :
$ abc.sh 5
1 I am Aditi
2 I am Aditi
3 I am Aditi
4 I am Aditi
5 I am Aditi
