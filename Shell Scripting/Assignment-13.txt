Write a script that assigns a variable that contains a list of all shell scripts (*.sh) in the current directory (command redirection). 
Using the 'for'statement from the course, iterate through that list of files and display the filename of each and cat out the contents to the terminal.

Ans : 

LIST=$(ls *.sh)
   
for i in $LIST
do      	
    itr=$( cat $i )
    echo "THE CONTENT OF $i are:"
    echo $itr
done

Output :
THE CONTENT OF abc.sh are:
#!/bin/bash #!/usr/bin/bash LIST=$(ls *.sh) for i in $LIST do itr=$( cat $i ) echo "THE CONTENT OF $i are:" echo $itr done
THE CONTENT OF abcd.sh are:
 done $fn just fun; do ts"ons
THE CONTENT OF assignment.sh are:
#!/bin/bash TODAYSDAY=$(date) USERFILES=$(ls) echo "$TODAYSDAY" echo "$USERFILES" alias t="STODAYSDAY"
THE CONTENT OF stripto.sh are:
 exit 0$REPLY"; do1 ]]; then>&2
